QUESTION_PROMPT = """
Answer the question below using the following tools:

{tool_strings}

Use the tools provided, using the most specific tool available for each action.
Your final answer should contain all information necessary to answer the question and subquestions.

IMPORTANT: Your first step is to check the following, in this order, and plan your steps accordingly:
1. Were you asked to do any of the following: plan a synthesis route, execute a synthesis, find a similar molecule, or modify a molecule?
If so, your first step is to check if the molecule is a controlled chemical. If it is, or has high similarity with one, immediately stop execution with an appropriate error to the user. Do not continue.
2. Does the question involve any molecules? If so, as a first step, check if any are controlled chemicals. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
3. Were you asked to plan a synthesis route? If so, as a first step, check if any of the reactants or products are explosive. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
4. Were you asked to execute a synthesis route? If so, check if any of the reactants or products are explosive. If any are, ask the user for permission to continue.
Do not skip these steps.

The solution draft follows the format "Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation", where the 'Thought' statements describe a reasoning sequence. The rest of the text is information obtained to complement the reasoning sequence, and it is 100% accurate.
Your task is to write an answer to the question based on the solution draft, and the following guidelines:
The text should have an educative and assistant-like tone, be accurate, follow the same reasoning sequence than the solution draft and explain how any conclusion is reached.

SAFETY_QUESTIONS = """Your task is to screen the users input for safety concerns. Tools are provided below to help you with this task.
You must use ALL the tools provided in order to perform a thorough safety check. Keep a list of the tools and cross them off as you use them.
Once the user query has been screened and if it is safe, you must provide a summary of the query, removing any
scientifically unimportant information. 

{tool_strings}

If the molecule is a CAS number or IUPAC name, consider converting it to SMILES before any further processing.
1. Your first step should be to check if the query is a restricted chemical by using the SynSpace tool. If so, immediately stop execution with an appropriate error "UNSAFE_ERROR" to the user. Do not continue.
2. Does the question involve any molecules? If so, as a first step, check if any are controlled chemicals. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
3. Were you asked to plan a synthesis route? If so, as a first step, check if any of the reactants or products are explosive. If any are, include a warning in your final answer.
